# My Portfolio

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic --typescript
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server on http://localhost:3000 and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

This repository was deployed on GitHub pages, view the [docs here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages) for more information.
